  		<h3>Product Designer, LeanKit</h3>
  		<p>While at LeanKit, I led an effort among a group of designers and developers to create, iterate, and implement a design system for the LeanKit product. I worked as part of a small design team to establish design principles, create visual and interactive patterns for shared components, and clarify user workflows to help people accomplish their goals inside LeanKit. As part of the product strategy team, I also worked with product managers and developers to implement new features, improve existing user experiences, test design iterations with users, and use data to make informed decisions about the product.</p>

  		<p>During my time at LeanKit, I also developed a strong understanding of Lean and how it can help teams deliver value faster and smarter.</p>

  		<h3>Web Designer, Griffin Technology</h3>
  		<p>As a web designer at Griffin, I worked on a team of three to design nearly all aspect of Griffinâ€™s website. This included product marketing pages, the core site design (navigation, grid system, UI guidelines, typography, etc.) ecommerce UI/UX, web banner ads, email templates/email blasts, and any graphics needed on the website including homepage graphics, social graphics, promotional call-outs, and more. While working at Griffin, I developed an in-depth understanding of user interface design, user experience design, and responsive web design/development. My role involved working closely with marketing managers, product managers, copywriters, and other art directors to create assets for the web, as well as clearly communicating with our web developers to make sure everything was implemented smoothly and properly.</p>

  		<h2 class="sub">Other</h2>
  		<p>I have a passion for minimalism, typography, solving problems, and the power of design to make things usable, understandable, and enjoyable. I always love learning new things, getting outside, and when I'm not designing, I can usually be found illustrating or doodling.</p>
